1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
So how are you guys, today I am going to talk about something

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,500
from whom everyone passes, does not matter. You are male, female

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,100
or others. This is the time when you don't understand

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,900
whats going on, the brain is saying something else heart is saying something else, and the body

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,600
has got some different plans, all three are going in different directions

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,300
Today I am going to talk about puberty, now if I ask you people

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,500
What is puberty? Then most of you will speak, d*ck

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:39,400
gets bigger and testicles get big. Yes so right, as you write this your parent's education fees have been all recovered (<b>Sarcastically</b>). But many things are not written in books, and even if they are then who is reading them? Then come on let start

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:48,900
without any fooling around. Self-conscious. Before puberty children don't care

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,800
how they look. Knee's are swollen, teeth are crooked

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,100
soil in mouth and hair is all messed up

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,400
but from puberty when they come to there senses, the girls

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,600
first, use to fight on little things, now they like to get all dressed up

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,800
the girls which use to roam here and there

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,700
in marriages now are trying cat walk

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,900
the girls which use to pull each other ponies now they

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,700
share gossips, who is dating with whom, who is getting all ready

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,900
for whom, if you get to know these two things then your life

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:38,600
is successful, and the world's worst dangerous illness, posting photos with a black and white filter like they don't have anything to live for. I would rather panda emoji, something

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,800
about him makes me and who is that him and who are you talking about the neighbor Prakash

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,300
who jumps from his 1st floor, and you will think what will be worse than that

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,500
But no, the ghost of English climbs like tomorrow is a flight to England

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,400
you must have seen that most of the girl talk in English

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,100
Why? We have to look after our image too

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,700
which girl will you love the one who says "Hey, where are you going?" or

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:11,900
"Hey, Mukesh where are you going" <b>(In Hindi)</b>. Now let's talk about the fool, idiot, and with no brains boys. The boys which use to play dangerous kabaddi

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,400
now they go to the gym. After coming from the first day of gym

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
will see themselves in the mirror-like they have achieved something great, there whole

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,500
the family name has been brightened and will pose like by looking them

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,700
Arnold himself will leap from the flying helicopter, these are my

31
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:38,400
biceps and triceps. (Dhinka chika) <b>(Ref from a Bollywood film)</b>. After that hardening their stomach

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,400
they will post a photo with their malnutrition abs, and all comment section filled with boys replying "Amazing body bro

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
help me too for making abs ". This should be illegal swear to god. When they would return home

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,200
the whole body would have been filled with injuries, and their smell would fell like

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,000
shit from pig, but they have got deodorant and perfume

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,400
and to finish them in 1 week is a religious belief.

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,800
Now they have to start to apply the gel, that spikes shit is important. But no matter how much you

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:20,900
dip yourself in makeup, if you are shit you will be shit. Deal with it. Money & Show Off. Now you must be thinking of how puberty and money

39
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,000
are related. Now the kid going through puberty

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
he doesn't have more important that his image, like in Rockstar <b>(Bollywood Movie)</b>

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,900
they say "Image is everything and everything is image", everything matters to him

42
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,100
Where is he going to buy the shoes, Nike or Bata? Where is he going shopping

43
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,200
mall or Sarojini Nagar (market in India)? Where is he going for dinner restaurant or

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,100
Pappu dhabha. He measures everything in money he doesn't care about the quality

45
00:03:49,100 --> 00:04:02,800
only it should be expensive. If you even give a magical yellow raincoat by saying it costs 4500INR, he will wear it happily. If the kid has an interest in sports then he wants the most expensive, even if he doesn't know how to play but with the bat

46
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,400
the bat should have an MRF sticker on it. If he has an interest in football then he will wear only the shoes

47
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,100
who has Nike written on it. Shoes don't matter to him he just wants that 8000INR Nike on it.

48
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:27,300
And football he wants Jabulani, which was used in the world cup. Like sisterf*cker will become Ronaldo tomorrow. During puberty in human, a bad and important thing take place called ego and show off

49
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:36,500
From PSP to dad's costly car, all show off is mandatory. Just think 14-year old whose name is Padu Padoda

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,700
his father brought Audi, see his Audi a*s torn. Now Padu Padoda

51
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,600
In his 14-year-old life as many insects, human, monster, and devil

52
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,700
he knows he will them all. When you will meet him

53
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,000
Somebody:- How are you? Padu:- Nothing, bro I just bought Audi. Somebody:- Oh congrats bro, OK listen

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Somebody:- Will come at noon for playing? Padu:- No bro, at noon I have to go to the salon in Audi.

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,700
Somebody:- Then in the evening? Padu:-Not in the evening, I will go to the gym in Audi.

56
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:13,200
Somebody:- Then at tuition? Padu:- No bro, I will go see Qutub Minar in Audi. Just shut the f*ck up. No, I don't understand

57
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,500
your father bought your father

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,300
paid for it your father will drive it you didn't do shit

59
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,600
still telling everyone i bought Audi i bought Audi

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,100
I bought an Audi. Anyway, your father bought it so you have full right on it

61
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:42,300
but what so much to show off. He bought a car, not a f*ucking country. Superiority & Aggression. The amount of attitude you will find in 13-14 year old kid

62
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,800
will be more than two 70-year-old men combined.

63
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,000
Every kid looks at the kid of his age and thinks

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
he is f*cker. If you look at this from this perspective, all the children are f*ucker then.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,900
And they proved this themselves. They live in their world

66
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,100
where they think are at the top and all others below them. While thinking the

67
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,300
even pick their nose. These people are that weird. You can

68
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,000
crash their scooter, they will say nothing. But if you take a piece of their pizza then

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,600
their soul's trembles. And when next day you again take their pizza

70
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
the piece, they will say nothing. But if you crash their scooter then

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,200
then will try to kill you. What do you want from life, what will you settle on. Now this

72
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,700
must have happened in the class with many of you. Head must be rotating randomly and

73
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,500
then you see your crush, love and they get lost

74
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,700
in their imaginary world. From Aashiqui till Jism 2 everything is done. Then you suddenly listen

75
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:49,500
Teacher:- Padu Padoda stands up and answer this question. Padu:- Sir, can I give while sitting? Teacher:- No, stand up and answer this question. Padu:- No sir I can't stand, can I answer while sitting.

76
00:06:49,500 --> 00:07:19,000
Teacher:-  Padu Padoda stands up. Friend:- When you know the answer why are you not standing? Padu:- My d*ck is erect bro. (Friend Laughing) Teacher:- You, why are you laughing (Friend Gulping) stand up and answer this question. Friend:- Sir can I also sit and answer?

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,300
Padu:- You also know the answer then why are you not standing?

78
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:32,700
Friend:- Bro my d*ck is also erect. (Khadha hai song) According to my worthless survey this incident

79
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,700
happens to every 100000 to 200000 boys. The world thinks girls are very

80
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,400
smart, quickly stand up and answer. It's not like that we don't

81
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:50,100
know the answer, just we can't stand. Conclusion. Now you people will say

82
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,600
if you have shared this info then tell the solution too.

83
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,000
See it's not a disease that can be cured. This happens to everyone.

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,900
It's natural. Natural f*cker. So you don't need to take it

85
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,300
seriously. Make fun. Enjoy Life.
